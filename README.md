# Fake-News-Detection
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and logistic regression.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used is from [Kaggle - Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or open the notebook and copy the code given:
   [code](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/Brindhaa372/fake_news_detection/blob/main/fake_news_detection.ipynb)
2. Upload the dataset (`news.csv` or equivalent)
3. Run all cells step-by-step

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Status
Complete and open for extension with deep learning or real-time web scraping.
